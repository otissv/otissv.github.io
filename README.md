##About me
Hi I'm Otis a self taught, design thinking full-stack JavaScript developer
with a passion for motion design. I'm currently living in Opole, Poland,
but originally from London. I'm an absolute geek and love geeking out on
all things Linux and JavaScript.

First fell in love with web design 20 years ago simply because it made my
Photoshop artwork come alive. Since then I have been hooked. Although my
focus for now is heavily in both frontend and backend web development.
My favorite development stack at the moment is React, UIkit, Node,
MongoDB, Redis and Arch linux are.

Values I hold high are loyalty, reliability, authenticity and helping
other achieve their success. Which is why I see projects through to the
end and why I believe in not only creating beautiful software but also
reliable and reflect the client's brand and that is easy to use so that
it does not distract the a user experience

Whether itâ€™s creating servers in Node, connecting to MongoDB databases or
designing unique user experiences per device whilst still maintaining a
consistent brand experience I will bring your ideas to life.
