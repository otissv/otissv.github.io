      Hi I'm Otis a self taught, design thinking full-stack JavaScript developer
      with a passion for motion design. I'm currently living in Opole, Poland,
      but originally from London. I'm an absolute geek and love geeking out on
      all things Linux and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      First fell in love with web design 20 years ago simply because it made my
      Photoshop artwork come alive. Since then I have been hooked. I still
      Photoshop or Sketch for first drafts howwever it still feels more natural
      to jump straight into HTML/CSS to design as the content always dictates
      the design. Which also means building the server API alongside so the
      frontend doesn't have any unnecessary features and is solely content
      driven. My favorite development stack at the moment is React, UIkit, Node,
      MongoDB and Arch linux are.
    </p>
    <p>
      Values I hold high are loyalty, reliability, authenticity and helping
      other achive their success. Which is why I see projects through to the end
       and why I believe in not only creating that is software beautiful but
       also reliable and reflect the clients brand and that is easy to use so
       that it does not distract the a user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I am not working I enjoy teaching English, exploring Poland (been
      here 5 months now), dancing Kizomba and reading. Mainly tech or startup
      books and blogs to stay on the cutting edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether itâ€™s creating servers in Node, connecting to MongoDB databases or
      designing unique user experiences per device whilst still maintaining a
      consistent brand experience I will bring your ideas to life.
